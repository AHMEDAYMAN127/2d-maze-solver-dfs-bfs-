# 2d-maze-solver-dfs-bfs-
Python maze solver using BFS and DFS. Reads mazes from .txt files (A=start, B=goal, space=open, others=wall). Displays the maze with Tkinter and animates the solution step by step. BFS finds the shortest path, DFS explores deep paths first. Supports large mazes with automatic scaling.
